### Members

### Description
This project's goal is to create a game that is playable.
As a player I want to play a game so that I can achieve a goal. 

### Vision Statement

To successfully and joyously complete the Tower Trouble game. 

### Motivation

As college students, in our spare time we want to entertain ourselves with something fun and even a bit silly. Majority of our group wanted to create a game so we decided to create Tower Trouble. 

### Risks

- Overall: There is a possibility that the feature creep could occur during the development of this application and that the graphics could be more complex than anticipated. There may also be a lack of access to the server for usability. 
- Mahalia: For this project the main risk is the overall design and development of a gaming application 
- Samuel: The main risk is over estimating what could be added into the project (aka planning for too much)
- Nelson: Overworking the front end and leaving a weak backend 
- Jordan: Overcomplicating the mechanics and/or getting stuck on one task for too long
- Spencer: Developing a robust database and backend based on a game could be an issue. We need to be sure to keep an eye toward project requirements instead of getting overly wrapped up in game mechanics. 

### Risk Mitigation Plan

- Overall: In order to prevent feature creep each member will stay updated on the Trello collaboration tool. 
- Mahalia: Learn the basics of game application development and typical requirements for games. 
- Samuel: Start with basics and then build on top plan one new feature at a time
- Nelson: Develop the project as a whole 
- Jordan: regular check-ins to maintain momentum and keep the scope of the project reasonable
- Spencer: Make regular goals in class meetings and see how each game feature aids in meeting course requirements.
