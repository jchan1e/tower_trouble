-- set up the db
create database scores;
use scores;

-- we only need one simple table, primary hidden key id auto-increments so same user can have multiple highscores
create table highscores (id int not null AUTO_INCREMENT, user VARCHAR(20), score int, PRIMARY KEY (id));

-- some dummy data to populate
insert into highscores (user, score) values("nelson", 100000);
insert into highscores (user, score) values("samuel", 1000000);
insert into highscores (user, score) values("theodore",10000000);
insert into highscores (user, score) values("jordan", 100000000);

-- display the highscores in order of highest score so we know it worked
select user, score from highscores order by score desc;
